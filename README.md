# Misc. iPXE related stuff.

Various scripts used mainly while compiling iPXE (i.e. [embeded scripts](http://ipxe.org/embed)).
Though also this repo will probably be populated with other misc scripts later on.

## Structure:

```
.
├── embeded
├── notes
└── config
    └── local
```

- embeded: Contains scripts I embed into iPXE during compile time
- notes: Contains various notes related to what I do with iPXE
- `config/local/`: A copy of my `ipxe/src/config/local` files.
